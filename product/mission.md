# Mission

## Product Vision

**ModuleForge** is a privacy-first, owner-controlled wiki platform designed for creative worldbuilders, storytellers, game designers, and anyone building interconnected knowledge systems. Unlike traditional wikis where anyone can edit anything, ModuleForge puts creators in complete control—every "module" (whether it's a character, location, item, or concept) belongs to its creator, who decides exactly who can collaborate.

The platform combines the rich, interconnected structure of wikis with the controlled collaboration of modern document tools, enabling creators to build comprehensive, media-rich universes while maintaining full creative control over their work.

## Target Users

### Primary Persona: The Creative Worldbuilder
- **Profile**: Writers, game designers, RPG enthusiasts, content creators
- **Pain Points**: 
  - Existing wikis are too open (anyone can vandalize/edit)
  - Note-taking apps lack rich interconnection features
  - Character database tools are too rigid or single-purpose
  - No good way to selectively collaborate with trusted friends
- **Needs**: 
  - Full control over who edits what
  - Rich, flexible content structure
  - Visual media support for character art, maps, etc.
  - Ability to link modules together (character → location → faction)

### Secondary Persona: The Collaborative Creator
- **Profile**: Co-authors, game master + players, creative teams
- **Pain Points**: 
  - Google Docs don't handle interconnected lore well
  - Shared Notion workspaces give everyone equal access
  - No granular permission control per piece of content
- **Needs**: 
  - Invitation-based collaboration per module
  - Clear ownership and version history
  - Structured yet flexible content organization

## Key Use Cases

1. **Fiction Worldbuilding**: Author creates modules for characters, locations, factions, and plot events, all interconnected with rich backstories and relationship maps

2. **RPG Campaign Management**: Game Master builds the world, invites players to collaborate on their character modules, maintains control over NPC and lore modules

3. **Game Design Documentation**: Designer builds interconnected modules for characters, items, abilities, and lore, organizing them into collections by game chapter/region

4. **Personal Knowledge Management**: User creates interconnected modules for any topic, with full control over structure and relationships

## Differentiators

| Traditional Wiki | ModuleForge |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Open editing by default | **Owner-controlled by default** |
| Rigid page structure | **Hybrid: structured metadata + free-form content** |
| Text-focused | **Rich media: images, galleries, embeds** |
| Global permissions | **Per-module invitation-based collaboration** |
| Flat organization | **Workspaces + collections + cross-linking** |
| Community-driven | **Creator-driven with selective collaboration** |

## Success Metrics

- **User Engagement**: Average modules created per active user
- **Content Richness**: Percentage of modules with media, links, structured fields
- **Collaboration**: Percentage of modules with invited collaborators
- **Retention**: 30-day and 90-day active user retention rates
